## Context
University assignment focused on demonstrating database usage and multi-panel UI layout under fixed constraints.

## What It Does

- Create, view, update, and delete book records

- Persists data using a relational database

- Three-panel layout mandated by assignment requirements

## Technical Focus

- C# (.NET)

- Database integration (stateful CRUD operations)

## Design Constraints

- The three-panel layout was required by the assignment. The focus was correctness and persistence rather than UX flexibility.

## What I Learned

- Managing application state across UI components

- Basic database schema design

- The concept of 'single source of truth'
